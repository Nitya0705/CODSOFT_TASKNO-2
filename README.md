# CODSOFT_TASK2 — Credit Card Fraud Detection 💳

This repository contains my solution for **Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection**,
completed as part of my Machine Learning Internship at **CodSoft**.

## 📌 Task Objective
Build a machine learning model to classify credit card transactions as
**fraudulent** or **legitimate** based on transaction data.

## 📂 Dataset
[Credit Card Fraud Detection — Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

- 284,807 transactions, of which only ~0.17% are fraudulent (highly imbalanced)
- Features: `Time`, `Amount`, and `V1`–`V28` (PCA-anonymized features)
- Target: `Class` (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraud)

## 🛠️ Approach
1. **EDA** — analyzed the severe class imbalance between fraud and legitimate transactions.
2. **Feature Scaling** — standardized `Amount` and `Time` using `StandardScaler`.
3. **Handling Imbalance** — undersampled the majority (legitimate) class in the
   training set only, keeping the test set realistic/imbalanced for honest evaluation.
4. **Model Training** — trained and compared three classifiers:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
5. **Evaluation** — used Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC instead of plain
   accuracy, since accuracy is misleading on imbalanced datasets.

## 📊 Results
| Model                | Precision | Recall | F1-score | ROC-AUC |
|-----------------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression   | 0.16 | 0.60 | 0.26 | 0.855 |
| Decision Tree         | 0.20 | 0.95 | 0.33 | 0.984 |
| Random Forest         | 0.29 | 0.92 | 0.44 | 0.994 |

Best model (selected by F1-score): **Random Forest**
